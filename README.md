## Description
Candy Invaders is a shoot-em-up style game where players control a candy ship and try to eliminate as many candy monsters as possible, 
all while trying to avoid getting hit by the poisonous candy goo that the candy monsters release. 

The more candy monsters you destroy, the better! However, if the candy monster gets you, or you get hit by too much poisonous candy goo, the game ends!

## Quick Video Demonstration of the Game
TODO - Add the video game demonstration.
